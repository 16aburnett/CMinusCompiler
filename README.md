# CMinusCompiler
Compiler for the CMinus programming language (developing as a project for CSCI 435 - Compilers)

# Usage
to use the compiler, download the repository and build the compiler with 
```
make
```
then run the compiler with a CMinus program
```
./CMinus yourProgram.cm
```
Currently the program only generates an AST so you will get a file with the same name with the `.ast` extention representing the AST.
